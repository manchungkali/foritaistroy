# My Developer Story: Creating forit.ai

## Discovering the Need

While noticing users struggling to find suitable AI tools, I identified a unique need. Many users weren't clear in describing what they were looking for and were only aware of a limited range of AI tools. This realization sparked the idea that led to the development of forit.ai.

## Development Journey

The journey to develop forit.ai took 5 days, filled with numerous challenges. Inspired by the potential to simplify the search for AI tools, I ventured into combining technology with practical utility. Despite the roadblocks, the motivation to create a useful product kept me going.

## The First Version

After some initial setbacks, including a venture into the Web3 meme market where I unfortunately faced a 60% loss, the support from my wonderful wife was unwavering. With an investment of 50 USD from her and 87 USD from myself, we secured the AI domain name forit.ai for two years.

The first version of forit.ai features:
- **AI Tool Listing:** A comprehensive page that lists AI tools, categorized for easy navigation.
- **Blogs:** Regular blog updates that introduce and detail the latest and most effective AI tools.

## Invitation for Feedback

I invite everyone to use forit.ai and share your feedback. Your suggestions are invaluable as we strive to improve and evolve to meet user needs. Please explore the various tools and let us know how we can make forit.ai even better.
