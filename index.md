## Discovering the Need

While noticing users struggling to find suitable AI tools, I identified a unique need. Many users weren't clear in describing what they were looking for and were only aware of a limited range of AI tools. This realization sparked the idea that led to the development of [forit.ai](https://forit.ai).

## Development Journey

The journey to develop [forit.ai](https://forit.ai) took 5 days, filled with numerous challenges. Inspired by the potential to simplify the search for AI tools, I ventured into combining technology with practical utility. Despite the roadblocks, the motivation to create a useful product kept me going.

## The First Version

After some initial setbacks, including a venture into the Web3 meme market where I unfortunately faced a 60% loss, the support from my wonderful wife was unwavering. With an investment of 50 USD from her and 87 USD from myself, we secured the AI domain name [forit.ai](https://forit.ai) for two years.

The first version of [forit.ai](https://forit.ai) features:
- **AI Tool Listing:** A comprehensive page that lists AI tools, categorized for easy navigation.
- **Blogs:** Regular blog updates that introduce and detail the latest and most effective AI tools.
