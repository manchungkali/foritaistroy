My Developer Story: Creating forit.ai

## Discovering the Need

While noticing users struggling to find suitable AI tools, I identified a unique need. Many users weren't clear in describing what they were looking for and were only aware of a limited range of AI tools. This realization sparked the idea that led to the development of [forit.ai](https://forit.ai).

## Development Journey

The journey to develop [forit.ai](https://forit.ai) took 5 days, filled with numerous challenges. Inspired by the potential to simplify the search for AI tools, I ventured into combining technology with practical utility. The development process was not smooth, however. I initially ventured into the Web3 meme market, hoping to fund the project, but faced a 60% financial loss.

Despite the financial setback, the support from my wonderful wife was unwavering. She contributed 50 USD, and I managed to add the remaining 87 USD, allowing us to secure the AI domain name [forit.ai](https://forit.ai) for two years. This significant support helped turn the vision into reality.

## The First Version

The first version of [forit.ai](https://forit.ai) features:
- **AI Tool Listing:** A comprehensive page that lists AI tools, categorized for easy navigation.
- **Blogs:** Regular blog updates that introduce and detail the latest and most effective AI tools.

## Invitation for Feedback

I invite everyone to use [forit.c ai](https://forit.ai) and share your feedback. Your suggestions are invaluable as we strive to improve and evolve to meet user needs. Please explore the various tools and let us know how we can make [forit.ai](https://forit.ai) even better.
